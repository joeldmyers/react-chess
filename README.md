# react-chess

This is using React + Typescript (+ Next.js mainly just for ease of deployment at this point) to create a working chess game.

Demo here: https://react-chess-o476zxr03-joeldmyers.vercel.app/

Note: this is currently a WIP.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repo
2. Install dependencies using `yarn`
3. Run the dev server using `yarn dev`
4. Go to `localhost:3000` to play chess :)

## To Do

- Add coordinates on the sides
- Add permitted moves methods for other pieces
- Get it so one can actually move the pieces (this would include killing pieces)
- Add a "pieces taken" component.
- Add in logic for check mate, with a message that says check mate and that freezes state.

### Optional

- Add in turn logic
- Connect to an AI API
- Finish Flip board logic
